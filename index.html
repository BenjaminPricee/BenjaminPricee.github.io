	<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

	<p>My name is Benjamin Price. I am currently a third-year student in South East Technological University in Carlow. My course is the Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Games Development, code CW208.
	<br>
	<br>
	My college course has provided me experience through subjects such as Programming, Gameplay Programming, Game Studies, Software Engineering and many more.
	<br>
	<br>
	I have also continued with my own projects under the name “Project Deception” over on Itch.io. Project Deception has allowed me to learn to create horror games utilising Unity and knowledge I have gained from my course. The project has also helped me delve into the games community.
